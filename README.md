# PISM_On_Cheyenne
This repository tells how to install PISM on Cheyenne

We need to install PETSc and other modules can be used directly. #Cheyenne has its own PETSc but I can't use it for PISM.

# Build_pism
 See the file: `README_pism.md`
 
 `bashrc_file` is the `.bashrc` for using PISM, the file may be invalid as Cheyenne changes.
